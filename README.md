# Making a Database
----
## Introduction
For my Master's thesis I want to create a database, which ideally outperforms some of the existing distributed databases in terms of throughput and latency for some specific scenarios. 

Many modern databases are implemented in C++ and C. Both of these languages I have some prior experience with. However I haven't worked with either in years so I will need to relearn these languages. Thus this repository will also store some of my lame attempts at making simple programs in C and C++ so that I can reacquaint myself with the languages.

Luckily I do not begin the Thesis phase of my master's program at the University of Copenhagen until 2020. So I am being proactive :). 


## Phase 1
I will be working through the Database implementation tutorial https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/. The tutorial is in C. Thus I will get familiar with the basics of implementing database and improve my C!
